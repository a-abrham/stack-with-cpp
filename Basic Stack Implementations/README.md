# we can implement stack using array and single linked list.

### As our goal in taking this course is to increase our coding efficiency, we have to be able to reduce the time complexity of our program and use memory efficiently.

#### Here is the detail to enable us to decide which data sturucture is suitable for us to implement stack ADT.

1. linked list
   Advantage:- fast insertion and deletions. - unlimited size (dynamic)
   Disadvantage:- slower access to the stored data.

2. array
   Advantage:- fast access to the stored data.
   Disadvantage:- slower insertion and deletion. - limited size(static)

### what we decide to implement our program is linked list since we don't want to specify the stack size at first. also we want take the advantage of fast deletion and insertion property.
